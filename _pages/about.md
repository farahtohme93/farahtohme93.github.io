I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at Goethe University Frankfurt, Germany.

My research focuses on macroeconomics, with particular expertise in heterogeneous agent models, and fiscal policy.

I have built research experience through roles at international institutions, including a PhD internship at the International Monetary Fund in 2023 and working as a Junior Researcher at the Leibniz Institute for Financial Research SAFE from 2020 to 2023.

## Research Interests
